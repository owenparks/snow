- Have to page through test results

- Problem with Inform7
    - Threaded Conversation did not work
        - Fixed version is in Git
        - TC from Git requires v11 of Convo Framework
    - Version of Convo Framework is v10 on website
        - Had to Google for HTML directory on Emily Short's website for this??
        - This is apparently called the Public Library??

    - After all this, Threaded Conversation worked until I tried to do subjects.
    - The example using the weather subject was broken.

- The Inform7 book does not even mention tables, according to the index

- Scene conditionals
    - [If scene is happening]
    - If the scene is scenename (does not work within strings)
    - Every turn during scenename
- Dialogue punctuation by Ron Newcomb is broken
    - Fixed it, it apparently does not like commas. Fuck.

- Example with math "x is a number that varies / change x to x+1" does not work, as I saw in an example.

Versioning:
I am writing Inform 7, the build number is 6L38, and the version is 1.54. Why does the build for Inform7 start with 6? Why do I need to know my build number? There are serious syntax changes and extension breakages between build numbers, so what is the version number supposed to indicate? When people tell me to upgrade "build numbers" which should not even have the level of difference of a minor version update, lots of things break. Really brittle plugin base

- When examining something/a noun for the first time:
    ACTUALLY means when examining ANY object for the first time

- Using menus, I need to release and then compile for things to work



Attempted to implement a relatively simple "is the player sleepy mechanic"
- Using truth states is wrong
- Using function that decides a conditional is right, but results in a loop that hard locks Inform
-
