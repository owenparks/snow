- Problem with Inform7
    - Threaded Conversation did not work
        - Fixed version is in Git
        - TC from Git requires v11 of Convo Framework
    - Version of Convo Framework is v10 on website
        - Had to Google for HTML directory on Emily Short's website for this??
        - This is apparently called the Public Library??

    - After all this, Threaded Conversation worked until I tried to do subjects.
    - The example using the weather subject was broken.

- The Inform7 book does not even mention tables, according to the index

- Scene conditionals
    - [If scene is happening]
    - If the scene is scenename (does not work within strings)
    - Every turn during scenename
- Dialogue punctuation by Ron Newcomb is broken
