====================
Someone want to call the police?
What, like the actual police?
Val looked at him blankly for a moment, the face of a woman realizing that if she wanted the job done right, she'd have to do it herself.
"I'm calling the Magistrate's office, give me your phone."
(give phone to her, show that it's broken)
(make sure player can't drop items)

===================
Valentine Elizabeth Carter. Born 1902, Los Angeles, CA. turned 1936 by Emil Carter.

It was all news to me.
======

She turned around and looked over her shoulder, holding me briefly in the piercing emerald gaze.

"You're the detective, you figure it out."

===================

Gold ring around Val's neck

-Guest_Arrival, three guests come back.
    - Elaborate on the plan for the ski weekend
        - Establish they're all old money except for one
    - Bring up the idea that it was someone from outside, a hunter

- Blackmail subplot
- Hunter Subplot
    - Stalker outside the house, extra set of footprints
    - Missing car

========

You don't seem like her type.
It wasn't really a question, so I let that 

=======

TODO: Cash in safe
TODO: Availability rules for the quips at the end (clue examination or not)

=========

Our eyes met over the car just before I got in, and in that moment, I barely recognized what was inside them. It was something approaching regret, the look of a gambler who had bet big and lost, and bled too much to the house to cut her losses. It was the look of an old man who has realized that a young man must inherit his war. I blinked, and it was gone, and the only things reflected there were the moon and the snow and the darkness.[line break]She got into the car, and for the first time I saw her necklace dangle out from her blouse, a gold ring on a tiny chain.

=======

Wire transfers then switches to cash
Either indicates two separate people, or else money got increasingly desperate

======

The blackmailer isn't a professional-- keeps asking for more and more money.
Crime is one of passion, or the blackmailer and the murderer are different people.

======

How did you know him, were you a student of his?
Do I strike you as one of the eager young undergrads he'd bring up here for a weekend?

========

VDet
What about your girlfriend? You think she could have done it?
??
You know what I think? I think Alan tried to ask the wrong person for help, I think he ended up running straight into the arms of his blackmailer, and that's why he got killed.
==============
Oh sure, he has a private jet and can get a tee time at Loch Lomond, but it's not as though that really fools any of us.

I know he bought his way into the Circle, just like he bought his way into any country club young enough to want him.

His "Patron"? Christ, what a joke. The way I heard it, he was a broke nobleman, and six figures changed hands once the deed was done. It's pathetic, really. No wonder the Circle's thinning out these days.
He looked me up and down. "Present company excepted, of course," he said, scarcely able to keep his lip from curling.
=======================================================

Protege?
She really hasn't told you anything about it?
He came up to me, leering. He put two fingers to my neck, pressed against my jugular. The fingers were soft and uncalloused, but the grip was wiry and strong.
I'd heard Val was waiting something like fifty years for the privilege, I can't imagine why she'd waste it on a pretty plaything like you.
He looked me up and down, taking a long drag on his cigarette.
"I suppose she could have done worse."
===============

TODO: The shades are open in parts, separating parts of the house with sunlight

==============================================


How the hell didn't you think that was relevant?
Because blackmailers don't kill their marks.
If you're right, then the blackmailer and the killer aren't the same person. If I'm right, then the blackmailer didn't come here intending to kill Alan, it just worked out that way.


=====

Nice car quip-- mention being lucky at poker.

=====

Must mention that vampires are sometimes made by accident 

====

ask who else
(include note why we're asking this-- someone had to know who the PC is in order to target him/her)

===========================================
Sunlight of Vdet proves there's hunter, says other suspect
But doesn't make sense to kill him since he's the biggest proponent of the hunter theory
=======
Did you know this was going to happen?
No.
========================================
(about Scott)
He ran some idiotic startup during the dot com boom. You know the kind, glass meeting rooms and a pony for every young programmer and bottles of Dom Perignon for staff parties. It went under like all the rest during the crash, but that hasn't kept him from bouncing back. I even heard he gave a TED talk about "The Success of Failing" or some bullshit like that, and they ate it up. These days there's still plenty of witless idiots in suits willing to throw money at the talentless idiots in polos. And willing to bring them into the Circle, terrified they'll miss the next big thing. None of these crusty old farts understand any of it, they're just terrified of looking out of touch.

========

Why you working so hard on this case? You'd never even heard of Alan until today.
Him and Val go way back, apparently. She owes him and I owe her. I pay my debts.

===================================
We've got a dead man upstairs.
Oh, no one's debating that, old boy. I just don't see the point of all these questions.
=============================
With the steady clacking sound of a roller coaster ascending (nah, too opposite) opaque metal shutters came down on every window in the place.
======
"If only he'd bought a security system"
And it turns out that actually he had installed one??
Yet the killer knew about it
    - That plus the fact that the PC's brakes were cut indicates premeditation
===========

I was dimly aware of the sound of the shutters closing which signaled the sunrise outside.

======

(On the car ride out)

[quotation mark] She looked at me with something approaching regret.".

==========

Your merit badge is cute. You been wearing it long?
I've worn the Mark for more than a hundred years, so longer than that police badge you've got.
I shrugged. Don't got it any more, had to give it up.
That's a real shame. Not to worry, I'm sure your new sugar mommy will be happy to look after you.

============

Your file said you used to work in homicide.
I've only been one of you people for 48 hours, and I already have a file?
You've had a file for three weeks now.
I didn't like that. I didn't like it so much I could hardly think of a cute comeback to make. He seemed to enjoy lording over me the fact that he knew something I didn't. It was probably a feeling he didn't get to enjoy very often.
"We all have files," he went on. "Did you think you could just get a hickey and you'd be in like Flynn, learn the secret handshake and everything? It takes resources to sweep something this size under the rug for this long. Know-how, connections, and money, and that means paperwork."

=========

Val
    - murder: I need you to solve this. Call it your first case in the private sector, call it a favor to me, I don't care. But you've got until the law gets here to look around unrestricted, and after that, who knows.

    - Alan: Did you know him well? As well as anyone. We were friends, I suppose, as much as any of us can be.
        - Enemies: I doubt he had many, if any at all. The Circle is old people with long memories, so you can imagine the politics. We all have a lot of people we'd like out of our hair, but not Alan. He kept out of all that, he just taught classes and lived the quiet life. Well, he did invite students up here or to one of his other houses for... recreational retreats every so often.
    - Hunter: It's possible. It's rare, but it does happen from time to time. Some nut gets it in their head
    - Circle: So you're telling me that I am now part of an international cabal of parasites. There's no need to be so dramatic about it. It's not like I recruited you into a Wall St. firm.
    - Patron:
     
    - House:
    - Blackmail: Did you know about this?
        - Why didn't you say something: Because I didn't think it was relevant. Why the hell wouldn't it be relevant? Because blackmailers don't kill their marks.

    - Nathan: He's in financial trouble (unlocked by having item or dialogue option?) and is trying to get an investment from Alan, and is using his knowledge of Alan's affair to get it

=========
    At crash scene
    Val:
        - about brake line
        - about file (if asked)
            - It's all supposed to be confidential

========================

So this hunter found out where Alan lives, came kitted out with gear to break in and kill him. He gets to the front door, tries to pick it with the skill of a drunk raccoon, finally gives up and breaks the door open. Alan doesn't hear him come in. Okay, that part could hold water, he had the radio turned up pretty high. But then they both sit down to a nice glass of the most expensive wine he had in his house, and then the guy stabs Alan with his own letter opener?

Available if
(if front door is examined)
(if letter opener is examined)

========================

Brake lines were cut by the blackmailer

=====================

Ask her about car
    - Leave it, no one's going to stumble on it anytime soon way out here. Our people will collect it once the storm breaks, to keep the police out of it.
    
=======================

Final scene

PC is sapped and tied up so that the killer can find out what he/she knows before killing them all and faking his own death to escape

planned to open all the shutters, 

(if PC has glass shard, can try to escape by cutting rope, otherwise, has to talk to stall)

========

A sunny place for shady people
- W Somerset Maugham
==============================


I was so focused on the clue that I didnt hear the door open. I didn't hear the footsteps, or the sound of fingers tightening around a fireplace poker.

I woke up with a headache like I'd kissed the Long Island Express goodnight.

==========================
(tied up)
I grinned like an idiot.
I hate cops, you're all the same. Every last one of you is for sale, snug in someone else's pocket. We all are. We try to fly towards the sun, but those clueless old shits with their piles of money don't let you forget who paid for the wings. They're pulling all our strings, man, and I'm cutting mine. I'm doing you a favor, really. You really want to live the rest of forever playing lapdog to someone else? You think you're ever going to have another dream, another idea she isn't put there to make you to dance like a puppet?

He had me dead to rights. I didn't know if anyone was still home, if anyone would hear if I yelled. I didn't want to try it unless I knew for sure help would come; that's really only a trick that works once. Despite that, his eyes burned with the bitterness and rage of a cornered man making his last stand. The shy nerd standing resentfully by the punch bowl was gone.

=========================

I looked down at him, sprawled out on the floor like he was making a snow angel. He'd been young and desperate, and his reckless blackmail of Alan had been a product of youth, and his panicked murder had been a product of his desperation. He thought he'd get his chance at greatness through angel investors, and then maybe the Circle. Maybe he'd made a deal with the devil, but I had a hard time blaming him. We'd all made the same one. What did any of us do when life had us over a barrel, and someone like Val came along, and offered to take a long drink? We sold a part of our soul just for a chance to spin the wheel one more time. Scott's number had just come up sooner than mine, and a little after Alan's. All of us were for sale.

Climbing quip dependent on asking about gear

==========

Untouched snow covered the valley in disheveled waves like an unmade bed.

==================

Scott

================

Even through the thick turtleneck he was wearing, I could tell from his size that his back and forearms got a lot of work. It didn't seem like he needed all that gear, I'd have believed he could claw his way to the top of Everest unaided.[paragraph break]The gray sweater had flecks of dark brown dried on it, only really visible in the light.

I was thirsty. And no quantity of a dead man's expensive bourbon was going to help.

I saw the shattered remains of the wine bottle I'd been hit with over in the corner by the fuse box.

As a matter of fact, shamus, I've got another murder for you to solve.

I have a little experience doing that.

This one's been cold for 40 years.

I like a challenge.
