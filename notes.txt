Story notes:

Several months prior to the game, Alan turns Kelly.
Kelly, horrified, writes to Alan and leaves him.
He finds another vampire willing to claim him as his patron.
Several weeks prior to the game, Alan is being blackmailed anonymously.
Alan pays several installments, but is determined to refuse as money runs low.
He emails Val, asking for help, and that he doesn't know who is blackmailing him. (Red Herring that she did it)
Says that he is being watched, so throws a party diguised as a ski/feeding weekend to meet with Val.

Blackmailer (Scott) arrives, realizes that Alan is no longer willing to pay.
Gets increasingly agitated, lets slip something only the blackmailer would know.
Realizes he's no longer anonymous, and a struggle ensues, knocking one of the wine glasses over the railing.
    - On the way out, marks up lock/breaks door, implying it's been picked
    - Fake because it implies that the hunter attempted to pick the lock, then failed and broke the door open, yet Alan didn't hear it.
Scott stabs Alan on the floor, resulting in a blood pool on the floor.
Scott moves body to chair to make it seem like a sudden attack.
Scott leaves in a hurry before other arrive, not wanting to be the one to "find" the body.

Blackmailer finds out that Alan is going to ask Val for help.

Dates in emails correspond to dates in tapes of security footage

Close enough that Val and Alan are on a first name basis

World:

Patron/protege (ward, proselyte)
    The old term comes from the wealthy aristocratic background of the first vampires, and the conceit that they are building their society through careful selection and support. 

This is largely untrue, as most do so for romantic liaisons, selfish reasons, money, and to have immortal playthings.
