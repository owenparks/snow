Blood on the Snow
An Interactive Fiction by spanky
Release 1 / Serial number 141207 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Mountain Road
They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was but one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I sped down the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Hell, maybe even going into private investigations. I guess I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective would just up and quit. I hoped he never did.

&gt;[1] drive

Mountain pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[2] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[3] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I&apos;m jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[4] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[5] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks, dislodging it from the frame and making myself an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter winter wind started to blow into the compartment. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

&gt;[6] any key
That noun did not make sense in this context.

&gt;[7] up

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

&gt;[8] get in
I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stiched leather. It even still smelled new.

Val drove the car, her eyes seemed like they were looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

&gt;[9] talk about
(the cell phone)
(addressing Val)
There was no reply.

I could have asked ask about her car, ask about the chalet or ask about sunrise.

&gt;[10] ask about chalet
Where are we going?

My house.

I could have asked ask about her car or ask about sunrise.

&gt;[11] ask about mercedes
&quot;Nice ride,&quot; I said.

&quot;You should have called,&quot; Val replied, ignoring my comment.

I could have asked ask about sunrise.

&gt;[12] ask about sunrise
&quot;Sun goes up at 7:03 today. Always check the time before you leave for the night,&quot; she said.

I looked out the window, trying not to feel like a kid being lectured by his mom.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere, and the cherry on top was that my cell phone was broken. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I&apos;m jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, and the moonlight I&apos;d briefly glimpsed was snuffed out by it.

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[3] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I&apos;m jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[4] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[5] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks, dislodging it from the frame and making myself an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter winter wind started to blow into the compartment. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

&gt;[6] any key
That noun did not make sense in this context.

&gt;[7] up

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

&gt;[8] get in
I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stiched leather. It even still smelled new.

Val drove the car, her eyes seemed like they were looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

&gt;[9] talk about
(the cell phone)
(addressing Val)
There was no reply.

I could have asked about her car, asked about the chalet or asked about sunrise.

&gt;[1] drive

Mountain pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[2] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[3] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I&apos;m jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[4] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[5] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks, dislodging it from the frame and making myself an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter winter wind started to blow into the compartment. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

&gt;[6] any key
That noun did not make sense in this context.

&gt;[7] up

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

&gt;[8] get in
I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stiched leather. It even still smelled new.

Val drove the car, her eyes seemed like they were looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

&gt;[9] talk about
(the cell phone)
(addressing Val)
There was no reply.

I could have asked ask about her car, ask about the chalet or ask about sunrise.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I&apos;m jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.
