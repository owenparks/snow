Mountain Road
They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

&gt;[4] drive

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[5] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[6] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[8] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[9] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn&apos;t that he was in good shape-- I doubted he&apos;d seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy.  I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.


 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

Whisper quiet, shutters slid down on the inside of every window in the house. They looked like opaque fabric window shades, but the heavy sound of the seal told me the core was probably metal. The moonlight went out as suddenly as if someone had thrown a curtain over it.

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[11] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[14] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

Sharp Bend
I walked on the snowy road about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the east.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn&apos;t that he was in good shape-- I doubted he&apos;d seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy.  I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

I kept a reasonable distance between the two of us on the bed, though she didn&apos;t seem the type to get prudish about that kind of thing. I lay there thinking for a long time, trying to put together everything I&apos;d heard into a picture that made sense. After five minutes that took two hours, I fell asleep, and dreamt of nothing.


(press any key)
I awoke to an empty room, bathed in the silver moonlight. She hadn&apos;t made a sound when she&apos;d left. It took a second for me to realize that the shutters had gone back up. Through the window, I could see that lights were starting to come on in the distant houses dotted across the mountainside.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d slept, but it must have been about eight o&apos;clock.

Val put her cigarette out and got up. Her expression was stony, the businesslike demeanor she&apos;d started with was gone now. Castillo got up, too, but stopped himself from saying anything. He didn&apos;t strike me as the sharpest tool in the shed, but he&apos;d clearly learned where the line was. Staying in the good graces of his employer meant staying within the level of harassment his job warranted, and not ruffling the feathers of anyone too important in the Circle.

&quot;You&apos;ll let me know if there&apos;s anything else I can do to help, Deputy?&quot; she said icily. She hadn&apos;t bothered looking at him as she said, it. She gave me a look full of meaning and left the room in the direction of the foyer and closing the door behind her. Castillo suddenly seemed very small standing behind the desk. He must have felt it, too, because he got up and left without another word to me.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

My Toyota Corolla in a fetching &quot;Regatta Blue&quot; that must have looked appealing under bright dealership lights when it was brand new back in 1990. I wouldn&apos;t know. It now sat on its side like a beached whale, exactly where I&apos;d left it. The key was still in the ignition.

I leaned into the cabin through the hole left by the windshield and turned the key. The headlights flicked on, and the dashboard lit up. I heard the radio bleat into the empty forest, muffled by the dull roar of air pouring out of the A/C vents. The engine turned over but didn&apos;t start. The inertia switch had cut off fuel to the engine when the car rolled down the hill. I didn&apos;t really mind, I hadn&apos;t planned on driving it out of here.

I put a hand behind the wheel and the suspension arm and felt along the metal tube of the brake line, nearly slicing my finger on a thin slit. It wasn&apos;t a bit of rust or metal fatigue, the cut was too clean. It might have been made by a dremel or a wire cutter. Cutting brake lines straight through would stop the front brakes from working. But a leak like this could take hours to affect performance. Whatever my state of mind or driving had been on that turn, this wasn&apos;t an accident.

The fact that I was able to see all of this without a flashlight barely registered.

Through the stillness of the house, I heard yelling upstairs. It started as a panicked cry of shock and surprise, but quickly turned to screams of agony. It went on, loud and incoherent, muffled by the wooden walls of the house, getting more raspy and strangled, like a pillow smothering a face. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. I felt a lump in my stomach like a lead weight, and reached for a gun that wasn&apos;t there.

I was so focused on trying to read the labels on the fuse box that I didn&apos;t notice the footsteps behind me. Maybe I wouldn&apos;t have anyway.

I was out before I hit the floor.

I woke up with a headache like I&apos;d kissed the Long Island Express goodnight. When I tried to put my hands up to feel the back of my head, I realized it was tied to the chair, along with my legs. He&apos;d gotten the drop on me, that was for sure.

Well, I was in pretty deep now. I looked around the dark room. No one to talk to but myself.

Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

I was miles from nowhere, and the cherry on top was that my cell phone was broken. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;We Three Kings&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I could see a broken wineglass and a glass shard here.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

There was something about the door that looked like a B&amp;E job.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open.

There was something about the door that looked like a B&amp;E job.

I could also see Val_HouseTODO here.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;We Three Kings&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

Val stood to my left, looking impassively at the body of Alan Bowden.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.



I could also see Nathan, Scott and Jan here.

(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

I checked my watch, it was getting late, almost noon. I had a million things to think about, but figured I should get a few hours of sleep while I still could.

I could see a bottle of bourbon here.

I thought about the idea that someone was just outside the window, peering in, waiting the way a hunter sits in a blind, waiting for ducks. I thought about the three men I&apos;d just met, and how I liked none of them. I thought about the man I&apos;d seen in the chair with his eyes wide open, who didn&apos;t seem to mind that I was drinking his bourbon, since he didn&apos;t mind much of anything anymore.

(press any key)
I awoke to an empty room, bathed in the silver moonlight. She hadn&apos;t made a sound when she&apos;d left. It took a second for me to realize that the shutters had gone back up. Through the window, I could see that lights were starting to come on in the distant houses dotted across the mountainside.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d slept, but it must have been about eight o&apos;clock.

It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

Val stood to my left, looking impassively at the body of Alan Bowden.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

Val stood to my left, looking impassively at the body of Alan Bowden.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

I heard the front door open, and the sound of voices from the foyer. It closed a minute later.


Val and I glanced at each other across the dead man, and she left back down the stairs.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

There was something about the door that looked like a B&amp;E job.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open.

I could also see Val_HouseTODO here.

I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

Val stood to my left, looking impassively at the body of Alan Bowden.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

[Scene &apos;Guest_Arrival&apos; begins]
I heard the front door open, and the sound of voices from the foyer. It closed a minute later.


Val and I glanced at each other across the dead man, and she left back down the stairs.
