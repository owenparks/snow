Mountain Road
They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

&gt;[4] drive

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[5] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[6] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[8] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[9] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

&gt;[11] up

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn&apos;t that he was in good shape-- I doubted he&apos;d seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy.  I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.


 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

Whisper quiet, shutters slid down on the inside of every window in the house. They looked like opaque fabric window shades, but the heavy sound of the seal told me the core was probably metal. The moonlight went out as suddenly as if someone had thrown a curtain over it.

They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[5] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[7] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[8] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

&gt;[11] get in
I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

I could have asked ask about her car, ask about the chalet or ask about sunrise.

&gt;[13] ask about sunrise
&quot;Sun goes up at 7:03 today. Always check the time before you leave for the night,&quot; she said.

I looked out the window, trying not to feel like a kid being lectured by his mom.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;We Three Kings&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I could see a glass shard and a broken wineglass here.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

Something caught my eye, something small and sharp, glinting in the light of the room as I walked around it. A shard of glass by the edge of the sofa.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

    <result xml:space="preserve">I looked at the plush carpet, checking it for footprints. A shoe size can be pretty damn circumstantial, but at this point, I needed every clue I could get.

I didn&apos;t see one, it was just as pristine as the drifts of snow in the valley below.

But something caught my eye, something small and sharp, glinting in the light of the room as I walked the perimeter of the rug. A shard of glass by the edge of the sofa.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I could see a glass shard and a broken wineglass here.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

&gt;[1] drive

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[2] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[3] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[4] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[5] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

&gt;[6] any key
That noun did not make sense in this context.

&gt;[7] up

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

&gt;[8] get in
I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

&gt;[9] talk to val
I said hello to Val.

I could have asked ask about her car, ask about the chalet or ask about sunrise.

&gt;[10] ask about sunrise
&quot;Sun goes up at 7:03 today. Always check the time before you leave for the night,&quot; she said.

I looked out the window, trying not to feel like a kid being lectured by his mom.

I could have asked ask about her car or ask about the chalet.

&gt;[11] ask about house
Where are we going?

My house.

I could have asked ask about her car.

&gt;[12] ask about car
&quot;Nice ride,&quot; I said.

&quot;You should have called,&quot; Val replied, ignoring my comment.

&gt;[13] wait
Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

&gt;[14] e

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

I could see Front_Door here.

&gt;[15] e

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. Jan Svennson was a broad-shouldered man with pale blue eyes. He was casually brushing snow off a European performance fleece sweater. Either he liked ice climbing, or he wanted people to think he did. He had the handshake of a salesman and the grin of a frat boy.

Scott Gage, on the other hand, was tall and lanky, and didn&apos;t seem at all suited to the cold. He wore a pair of Japanese selvedge jeans with the cuffs turned up to make sure everyone knew it. I&apos;d have guessed he&apos;d picked them up somewhere in SoHo if it weren&apos;t for the sweater he was wearing, useless against real cold, as all Californian sweaters are. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.


I could also see Front_Door here.

&gt;[16] e

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall dark rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous against the pattern of the fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I could hear &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a wool cardigan, stained on the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a large carving knife was sticking out of his chest, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine here.

&gt;[3] drive

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[4] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[5] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[7] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[8] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
[Rule &quot;room description body text rule&quot; applies.]
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere, and the cherry on top was that my cell phone was broken. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

[Rule &quot;room description body text rule&quot; applies.]
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

[Rule &quot;room description body text rule&quot; applies.]
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

&gt;[5] drive

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

&gt;[6] drive

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

&gt;[7] brake
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

&gt;[9] unbuckle seat belt
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

&gt;[10] kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a  ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My overturned car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

I was miles from nowhere. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.

Fucking swell.

Sharp Bend
I stood about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the south.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

I got into the Mercedes.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

&quot;Sun goes up at 7:03 today. Always check the time before you leave for the night,&quot; she said.

I looked out the window, trying not to feel like a kid being lectured by his mom.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open to the porch.
 I could tell right away that something was wrong, like the door had been damaged somehow.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered screens in front of the door. The shiny black wood was decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open to the porch.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn&apos;t that he was in good shape-- I doubted he&apos;d seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy.  I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

Whisper quiet, shutters slid down on the inside of every window in the house. They looked like opaque fabric window shades, but the heavy sound of the seal told me the core was probably metal. The moonlight went out as suddenly as if someone had thrown a curtain over it.
