A Long Drink
An Interactive Mystery by Owen Parks
Release 7 / Serial number 150217 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Mountain Road
They say you shouldn&apos;t drive when you&apos;re angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I&apos;d had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective&apos;s desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I&apos;d turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I&apos;d seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn&apos;t figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

I kept on driving north.

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: a snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew wasn&apos;t my idea of a good time. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: a snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn&apos;t manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell in a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight. Everything went black.

Upturned Car
I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to focus.

The car was currently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could dimly see the light of the moon, mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in; the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

Sharp Bend
I walked on the snowy road about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the east.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

I awoke to an empty room, bathed in the silver moonlight. She hadn&apos;t made a sound when she&apos;d left. It took a second for me to realize that the shutters had gone back up. Through the window, I could see that lights were starting to come on in the distant houses dotted across the mountainside.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d slept, but it must have been about eight o&apos;clock in the evening.

His size and heavy brow made him look like a gorilla in Prada.

He introduced himself as &quot;Adrian Castillo, Deputy to the Warden of the Peace, appointed to serve at the pleasure of the Honorable Countess of Westchester.&quot; I didn&apos;t know what most of that meant, but I knew his suit was a little too nice for a cop entirely on the level.

Val put her cigarette out and got up. Her expression was stony, the businesslike demeanor she&apos;d started with was gone now. Castillo got up, too, but stopped himself from saying anything. He didn&apos;t strike me as the sharpest tool in the shed, but he&apos;d clearly learned where the line was. Staying in the good graces of his employer meant staying within the level of harassment his job warranted, and not ruffling the feathers of anyone too important in the Circle.

&quot;You&apos;ll let me know if there&apos;s anything else I can do to help, Deputy?&quot; she said icily. She hadn&apos;t bothered looking at him as she said it. She gave me a look full of meaning and left the room in the direction of the foyer, closing the door behind her. Castillo suddenly seemed very small standing behind the desk. He must have felt it, too, because he got up and left without another word to me.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val&apos;s Mercedes was parked to one side of the driveway.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

My Toyota Corolla in a fetching &quot;Regatta Blue&quot; that must have looked appealing under bright dealership lights when it was brand new back in 1990. I wouldn&apos;t know. It now sat on its side like a beached whale, exactly where I&apos;d left it. The key was still in the ignition.

The inertia switch had cut off fuel to the engine when the car rolled down the hill. I didn&apos;t really mind, I hadn&apos;t planned on driving it out of here.

Cutting brake lines straight through would stop the front brakes from working. But a leak like this could take hours to affect performance. Whatever my state of mind or driving had been on that turn, this wasn&apos;t an accident.

The fact that I was able to see all of this without a flashlight barely registered.

I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door.

It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

I hadn&apos;t realized it until I saw an edge of light blue on the horizon, but we&apos;d cut things pretty close again. A quiet whirring of the closing shutters and a click of the lock was the only indication that the sun was about to rise. The foyer went artificially dark again, except for the light of the brass chandelier.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Through the stillness of the house, I heard yelling upstairs. It started as a panicked cry of shock and surprise, but quickly turned to screams of agony. It went on, loud and incoherent, muffled by the wooden walls of the house, getting more raspy and strangled, like a pillow smothering a face. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. I felt a lump in my stomach like a lead weight, and reached for a gun that wasn&apos;t there.

Kitchen
I stepped into a kitchen big enough for a game of football. Wooden cabinets and handsome tile in earth tones went from wall to wall. The quaint country look was somewhat ruined by the collection of modern stainless steel kitchen appliances. They were brand new and it looked like not one of them had been used. It figured, this didn&apos;t seem like the kind of place that had a cooking staff.

The second I walked into the dark wine cellar, recessed lights in the ceiling turned on, probably activated by a motion sensor. 

 A wine rack ran the perimeter of the room, holding enough bottles to supply a French restaurant. A few seemed to be missing here and there. A wooden chair sat in the corner.

[Scene &apos;DiscoverDet&apos; ends]
I was so focused on trying to read the labels on the fuse box that I didn&apos;t notice the footsteps behind me. Maybe I wouldn&apos;t have anyway. I heard a dull crack and realized it was the sound of a heavy bottle hitting the back of my head. It was the last thing I remembered thinking about before the rush of unconsciousness. I was out before I hit the floor.

I woke up with a headache like I&apos;d kissed the Long Island Express goodnight. When I tried to put my hands up to feel the back of my head, I realized it was tied to the chair, along with my legs. He&apos;d gotten the drop on me, that was for sure.

Well, I was in pretty deep now. I looked around the dark room. No one to talk to but myself.

A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

My Toyota Corolla in a fetching &quot;Regatta Blue&quot; that must have looked appealing under bright dealership lights when it was brand new back in 1990. I wouldn&apos;t know. It now sat on its side like a beached whale, exactly where I&apos;d left it. The key was still in the ignition.

Cutting brake lines straight through would stop the front brakes from working. But a leak like this could take hours to affect performance.

The fact that I was able to see all of this without a flashlight barely registered.

It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

I hadn&apos;t realized it until I saw an edge of light blue on the horizon, but we&apos;d cut things pretty close again. A quiet whirring of the closing shutters and a click of the lock was the only indication that the sun was about to rise. The foyer went artificially dark again, except for the light of the brass chandelier.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

[Scene &apos;DiscoverDet&apos; begins]
Through the stillness of the house, I heard yelling upstairs. It started as a panicked cry of shock and surprise, but quickly turned to screams of agony. It went on, loud and incoherent, muffled by the wooden walls of the house, getting more raspy and strangled, like a pillow smothering a face. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. I felt a lump in my stomach like a lead weight, and reached for a gun that wasn&apos;t there.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

I wasn&apos;t sure how long I&apos;d been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I&apos;d tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally a little shocked and unfocused.

The car was presently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could see moonlight, dimly mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I grabbed my bag and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

Sharp Bend
I walked on the snowy road about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the east.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

&quot;Get in,&quot; she said.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

&quot;Come on, I&apos;ll introduce you to Alan,&quot; she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

There was something about the door that looked like a B&amp;E job.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug. 

The front door stood open.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

I could tell he didn&apos;t get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn&apos;t fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I&apos;d driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I&apos;d seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, &quot;Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend.&quot;

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren&apos;t letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.



I could also see Nathan, Scott and Jan here.

(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

&quot;Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan&apos;s dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed.&quot;

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. &quot;I&apos;m going to call it in to the New York Magistrate&apos;s and find out who isn&apos;t on vacation that they can send over.&quot; She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. &quot;It&apos;s going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they&apos;ll have to make it through what&apos;s left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who&apos;s responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up.&quot;

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. &quot;Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you&apos;re presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn&apos;t just kill Alan?&quot;

Val shrugged and pointed at me. &quot;It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I&apos;m mistaken.&quot;

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn&apos;t, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. &quot;You&apos;re making a big mistake. Don&apos;t you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there&apos;s someone out there who got Alan, and now we&apos;re sitting ducks.&quot;

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn&apos;t have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

The designer charcoal suit he wore hadn&apos;t quite been successfully altered to his wide frame. A deep purple tie sat at his neck in a fat knot Donald Trump would have approved of. The dark hair atop his head was neatly parted at the side, and slicked back almost flat to his head. His eyes were gray, and there was something baleful deep in them, peering out.  His size and heavy brow made him look like a gorilla in Prada.

He introduced himself as &quot;Adrian Castillo, Deputy to the Warden of the Peace, appointed to serve at the pleasure of the Honorable Countess of Westchester.&quot; I didn&apos;t know what most of that meant, but I knew his suit was a little too nice for a cop entirely on the level. I wondered if that all fit on his business card.

Val put her cigarette out and got up. Her expression was stony, the businesslike demeanor she&apos;d started with was gone now. Castillo got up, too, but stopped himself from saying anything. He didn&apos;t strike me as the sharpest tool in the shed, but he&apos;d clearly learned where the line was. Staying in the good graces of his employer meant staying within the level of harassment his job warranted, and not ruffling the feathers of anyone too important in the Circle.

&quot;You&apos;ll let me know if there&apos;s anything else I can do to help, Deputy?&quot; she said icily. She hadn&apos;t bothered looking at him as she said it. She gave me a look full of meaning and left the room in the direction of the foyer, closing the door behind her. Castillo suddenly seemed very small standing behind the desk. He must have felt it, too, because he got up and left without another word to me.

A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor.

A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it&apos;d cut through the snow and brush.

My Toyota Corolla in a fetching &quot;Regatta Blue&quot; that must have looked appealing under bright dealership lights when it was brand new back in 1990. I wouldn&apos;t know. It now sat on its side like a beached whale, exactly where I&apos;d left it. The key was still in the ignition.
 The power was on, and the dashboard blinked orange and red lights at me.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val&apos;s Mercedes was parked to one side of the driveway.

Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

I hadn&apos;t realized it until I saw an edge of light blue on the horizon, but we&apos;d cut things pretty close again. A quiet whirring of the closing shutters and a click of the lock was the only indication that the sun was about to rise. The foyer went artificially dark again, except for the light of the brass chandelier.

The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;We Three Kings&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Through the stillness of the house, I heard yelling upstairs. It started as a panicked cry of shock and surprise, but quickly turned to screams of agony. It went on, loud and incoherent, muffled by the wooden walls of the house, getting more raspy and strangled, like a pillow smothering a face. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. I felt a lump in my stomach like a lead weight, and reached for a gun that wasn&apos;t there.

Wine Cellar
The second I walked into the dark wine cellar, recessed lights in the ceiling turned on, probably activated by a motion sensor. 

 A wine rack ran the perimeter of the room, holding enough bottles to supply a French restaurant. A few seemed to be missing here and there. A wooden chair sat in the corner.

I was so focused on trying to read the labels on the fuse box that I didn&apos;t notice the footsteps behind me. Maybe I wouldn&apos;t have anyway. I heard a dull crack and realized it was the sound of a heavy bottle hitting the back of my head. It was the last thing I remembered thinking about before the rush of unconsciousness. I was out before I hit the floor.

Wine Cellar
I woke up with a headache like I&apos;d kissed the Long Island Express goodnight. When I tried to put my hands up to feel the back of my head, I realized it was tied to the chair, along with my legs. He&apos;d gotten the drop on me, that was for sure.

Well, I was in pretty deep now. I looked around the dark room. No one to talk to but myself.

I could see myself here.

Val opened the door noiselessly behind him. She tiptoed behind him quietly on stockinged feet, her eyes never leaving him. She moved deliberately and gracefully, like a show I&apos;d once seen of a panther stalking an impala. Neither of them seemed to really be in a hurry.

It&apos;ll be easy. A house full of corpses turned to ash, I can just make sure it looks like mine is among them. I disappear, and start over with a new life. It&apos;s easy enough to pull off, we all have to do it every fifty years or so. No one will come looking for me, we&apos;ll just be tragic victims of some rogue hunter. I take care of you and the lady, open all the shutters, and that&apos;s that. Come sundown, that makes a clean getaway.

His eyes went wild, and for a moment I felt like I could actually see his nerves fray and snap. His upper lip curled back over bared teeth so far it looked inhuman. It was the yellow-eyed look of a wolf baring its fangs. He was no wolf, but maybe he was so livid, he&apos;d just forgotten. He whirled the gun around to point it straight at Val&apos;s serene face, and pulled the trigger. Her head was nowhere near the gun when it went off. She&apos;d ducked to the side faster than I&apos;d seen anyone move before, like Mayweather slipping a punch.

When Scott tried to aim the gun at her this time, screaming an unearthly scream, her hands were already up in a blur. She let him get another shot off, which I remember thinking was pretty charitable of her. There was nothing resembling charity in her green eyes, burning with a cold fury. It seemed for a second like she&apos;d disarmed him as the gun dropped to the floor. It took an eternity to fall. Then I noticed in the dim light of the wine cellar a glint of silver attached to his neck, a small knife labeled with the initials &quot;AHB.&quot; His empty hands went to his throat, and he crumpled over. We listened to quiet gasping for a minute as Val came over to untie me from the chair. By the time she&apos;d finished, it had stopped.

&quot;What was the last time you were in Vegas, kid?&quot; We got in and I started the car. &quot;It&apos;s a long story, let me start at the beginning,&quot; she said.

We started off down the road and we began to talk, really talk, for the first time since I&apos;d met her. We started off down the long road to the Mojave, in the shadow of the  mountain, high above the valley and its waves and ribbons of untouched snow like an unmade bed. 

I was already getting thirsty, and no quantity of expensive bourbon was going to help.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;Hark, The Herald Angels Sing&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val&apos;s Mercedes was parked to one side of the driveway.

I could also see Val_SecondInv_TODO here.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Val opened the door noiselessly behind him. She tiptoed behind him quietly on stockinged feet, her eyes never leaving him. She moved deliberately and gracefully, like a show I&apos;d once seen of a panther stalking an impala. Neither of them seemed to really be in a hurry.

It&apos;ll be easy. A house full of corpses turned to ash, I can just make sure it looks like mine is among them. I disappear, and start over with a new life. It&apos;s easy enough to pull off, we all have to do it every fifty years or so. No one will come looking for me, we&apos;ll just be tragic victims of some rogue hunter. I take care of you and the lady, open all the shutters, and that&apos;s that. Come sundown, that makes a clean getaway.

His eyes went wild, and for a moment I felt like I could actually see his nerves fray and snap. His upper lip curled back over bared teeth so far it looked inhuman. It was the yellow-eyed look of a wolf baring its fangs. He was no wolf, but maybe he was so livid, he&apos;d just forgotten. He whirled the gun around to point it straight at Val&apos;s serene face, and pulled the trigger. Her head was nowhere near the gun when it went off. She&apos;d ducked to the side faster than I&apos;d seen anyone move before, like Mayweather slipping a punch.

When Scott tried to aim the gun at her this time, screaming an unearthly scream, her hands were already up in a blur. She let him get another shot off, which I remember thinking was pretty charitable of her. There was nothing resembling charity in her green eyes, burning with a cold fury. It seemed for a second like she&apos;d disarmed him as the gun dropped to the floor. It took an eternity to fall. Then I noticed in the dim light of the wine cellar a glint of silver attached to his neck, a small knife labeled with the initials &quot;AHB.&quot; His empty hands went to his throat, and he crumpled over. We listened to quiet gasping for a minute as Val came over to untie me from the chair. By the time she&apos;d finished, it had stopped.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard &quot;God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen&quot; warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

Hairpin Turn
If I&apos;d finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might&apos;ve noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.
