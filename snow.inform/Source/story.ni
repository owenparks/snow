The story description is "The first time I'd met Val was the day before yesterday, on my way out of the hospital. I'd been in a numb stupor for hours. There's no good way to take that kind of news.  She'd asked me out for a drink. I remember thinking there was something Old Hollywood glam about her, like Veronica Lake or Lauren Bacall. I figured she was trouble, but I had nothing to lose, and she looked like my kind of trouble. Turns out I didn't know the half of it.

Daybreak was just a few hours away. I stared at the crumpled remains of my car, and beyond to the frozen lake below. I wondered if I'd ever see her again.".

I had planned on a senior detective's desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.[paragraph break]Not six hours earlier, I'd turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I'd seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn't figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.[paragraph break][hint reminder]"

The description is "I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: a snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever."

Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn't manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell into a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight.[paragraph break]";

Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I'd tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally unfocused.[paragraph break]The car was currently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could dimly see the light of the moon, mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.[if Upturned Car is strapped][paragraph break]I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.[end if][if Upturned Car is unstrapped][paragraph break]I crouched at the bottom of the car on the driver door, trying to figure the best way out.[end if]".

The driver door is scenery in the Upturned Car.

It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I pulled my coat tight around me, and stepped out into the forest.[paragraph break]".;
	say "(press any key)";
	wait for any key;
	Now the player is in the Bottom of Cliff;

Chapter 4 - Scene Cliff_Climbing

Bottom of Cliff is a room. Bottom of Cliff is below Sharp Bend. The description is "I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it'd cut through the snow and brush.[if Cliff_Climbing is happening][paragraph break]I was miles from nowhere, and the cherry on top was that my cell phone was broken. It had stopped snowing for the moment. The night sky was starting to lighten, I figured I had an hour before sunrise.[paragraph break]Fucking swell.[end if]".

[TODO: Add scenery]
Val is a woman. Val is in the Sedan. The description is "The first thing I noticed were the dark green eyes, clear even driving down a street with no lights. She looked to be in her thirties, but she could have been three hundred for all I knew. Her face shone in the moonlight, pale and beautiful and unnatural. She was wearing too-red lipstick, which gave her the look of a Venetian mask. Wavy auburn hair framed a face I wouldn't have kicked out of bed for eating crackers.[paragraph break]".

	Otherwise:

Through what must have been some quirk of fate, I never made it to the chalet. I smiled sardonically at the sunrise, searing like a fire newly kindled, even on that cold, windswept ridge.

The description is "She wore a belted black raincoat with straight shoulders, which covered all of her except for the bottom of a long pencil skirt. She hadn't bothered taking her driving gloves off.

Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to."
House is scenery in the Driveway. Understand "facade/chalet/lodge" as house. The description is "It seemed oddly imposing for what was just another vacation home in the Adirondacks. From the front, it looked like two or three spacious floors with high ceilings. The steeply angled roofs were clearly designed to shed the several feet of snow dumped on it by nor'easters every year. ".

Foyer is a room. The description is "I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.[if Body_Discovery is happening][paragraph break]A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.[end if]
[if Guest_Arrival is happening][paragraph break]Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. [paragraph break]I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren't letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.[end if]"

Section 2 - Greatroom

Greatroom is a room. Greatroom is east of the Foyer. The description is "The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.
	
A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark [if the stain is examined]wine [end if]stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. [if the fire is lit]A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.[end if]

A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.[if the scene is body_discovery][paragraph break]A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open.

The body is scenery in the reading_nook. Understand "corpse / man" as body. The description is "He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn't that he was in good shape-- I doubted he'd seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy. I could tell he didn't get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn't fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I'd driven it off a cliff a few hours ago."[TODO: Master Bedroom closet, one pair of boots, unused]

It didn't look that long or that sharp, but someone had made a pretty clean business of stabbing Bowden with it. Or maybe they'd just gotten lucky. It happens like that sometimes."

the shelves are scenery in the reading_nook. Understand "bookshelves" as shelves. The description is "Mostly non-fiction: scholarly journal archives, collections of essays, and books on literature.

Section 1 - Main House

Section 2 - Hallway Downstairs

Hallway_Downstairs is a room. Hallway_Downstairs is east of the Greatroom. The printed name is "Downstairs Hallway". The description is "A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured."

the painting is scenery in the Hallway_Downstairs. it is a closed openable container. The description is "An oil painting of a crowded scene, bright colors jumping out from shadows and mottled light coming down from above. Everyone in the painting seemed pretty upset, though it wasn't really apparent why. It looked like it was done in the Romantic style, but I'm no art historian. It could just as easily have been the Old Testament as Paradise Lost.".

Carry out opening the painting:
	say "I felt around the edges of the gold-trimmed frame and found a latch. The entire painting swung off the wall smoothly, like the hinges were well oiled. A refrigerated compartment inside leaked cold vapor like an old sci-fi movie used dry ice. It was full of plastic pouches.";

	say "I tried not to look at the viscous contents as I tore off the end of the plastic with my teeth. I closed my eyes and forced myself to keep drinking until it was empty. It warmed me like drinking spiced cider by the fireside. Until that moment, I hadn't realized how cold I'd been.";
	now Blood_status is true;
	remove the pouch from play.

Section 3 - Kitchen
			
Kitchen is a room. Kitchen is east of the Hallway_Downstairs. The description is "I stepped into a kitchen big enough for a game of football. Wooden cabinets and handsome tile in earth tones went from wall to wall. The quaint country look was somewhat ruined by the collection of modern stainless steel kitchen appliances. They were brand new and it looked like not one of them had been used. It figured, this didn't seem like the kind of place that had a cooking staff.".

Section 4 - Office

Office is a room. Office is north of the Hallway_Downstairs. The description is "Of all the rooms I'd seen in the house, this one looked the most lived in. It had the musty smell of old books mixed with stale coffee coming from several cups on the desk.".

cups are scenery in the office. The description is "Mugs of coffee, stone cold. I could see rings on the sides of the half-empty cups where the liquid had evaporated. They'd been here a few days, but that didn't indicate a time of death. The kind of man who leaves more than two coffee cups sitting on a desk isn't in a hurry to clean up after himself.".
Instead of taking the cups:
	say "Val asked me to find his killer. I wasn't going to do his dishes.";

the desk is scenery in the office. the desk is a closed openable container. The description is "Unlike most of the other expensive furniture in the house, it looked like the mahogany desk got a lot of use. A computer at least five years old, sat on it, the keyboard mostly buried by papers and books. Worn brass handles barely hung on to a row of drawers along the right side.";

the papers are scenery in the Office.
Instead of examining papers:
	say "I thumbed through the pile on the desk, finding term papers and dissertations, collections of academic journals. Underneath most of it was something that caught my eye, a document with dollar signs on it and more zeroes than I'm used to seeing on paper.";

Section 5 - Basement

Wine_Cellar is a room. Wine_Cellar is below the Hallway_Downstairs. The printed name is "Wine Cellar". The description is "The second I walked into the dark wine cellar, recessed lights in the ceiling turned on, probably activated by a motion sensor.
[paragraph break]
A wine rack ran the perimeter of the room, holding enough bottles to supply a French restaurant. A few seemed to be missing here and there. A wooden chair sat in the corner."

The wooden chair is scenery in the Wine_Cellar. The description is "A simple chair made from dark wood, appearing to have woven reeds for the seat. It's probably just here to add to the country style decor, I can't imagine anyone sitting in the cellar drinking wine long enough to use it.".

The wine rack is scenery in the Wine_Cellar. The description is "What had to be about a hundred dark green bottles rested in the diamond-crossed wooden cubbyholes, corks facing out.[paragraph break]I took a look at the gaps in the collection. A couple were missing from a section of Californian whites. One was missing from the other end, the hole surrounded by bottles of Burgundy red."

Hallway_Upstairs is above the Hallway_Downstairs. The printed name is "Upstairs Hallway". The description of Hallway_Upstairs is "I stood in a normal-sized hallway that seemed cramped compared to the dimensions of the rest of the house. The hardwood floor was just as polished as the one downstairs. To the east were a couple of the smaller rooms clearly intended for overnight guests. To the north was another bedroom, and a set of double doors that led to the master suite.".

North_Hallway is north of the Hallway_Upstairs. The printed name is "North Hallway". The description is "The northmost section of the upstairs hallway led to a couple of guest bedrooms.".

East_Hallway is east of the Hallway_Upstairs. The printed name is "East Hallway". The description is "The eastern side of the upper floor led to several guest bedrooms. A window [if SHUTTERS_DOWN is false]looked out onto the valley and a vast lake, a real one put there by nature, not a big hole dug by a developer to increase 'lakeside' property values.[end if][if SHUTTERS_DOWN is true]faced north, blocked by the closed shutter.[end if]".

A four-poster bed with a thick down comforter looked like it would sink at least half a foot under any weight. Ornate wooden nightstands flanked the bed on either side. One was bare except for a lamp, the other was piled high with what must have been bedtime reading. In the corner of the room, I could see into a spacious closet."

the book is a clue. the book is in the Master_Bedroom. The description is "[italic type]Kokoro[roman type], by Soseki Natsume. The binding looked expensive and uncracked. A post-it note was stuck to the cover. Just two words were written on it: [quotation mark]I'm sorry.[quotation mark][paragraph break]I started to flip through the book and noticed something handwritten on the title page. The cursive looked like it'd been written with a fountain pen.[paragraph break][paragraph break]For Kelly[line break]     Somewhat appropriately, I got this book from my teacher, and now I'd like you to have it. More than whatever literary value it may have, from now on, I'll always remember it as the first book we read together.[paragraph break]Yours,[line break]Alan".

Walk-in closet is scenery in the master_bedroom. The description is "I walked into the closet and flicked on the light. Three quarters of it was the usual cruft that finds its way to a person's closet and never gets worn.[paragraph break]I looked at the rest of it. A handful of suits that looked like they'd been bought in the 80s, judging by the lapels. Performance fleece winter gear and hiking boots, none of it looked like it had been worn. Velvet smoking jacket, no sweatpants or loungewear. Professor Bowden seemed to have some old-fashioned sensibilities.".

the cash is in the wall safe. the cash is a clue. The description is "five neat stacks of worn bills, each banded with a gold paper strip reading '10,000.'".

the photos are a clue. The description is "Several photographs of a blonde young man in his early twenties, taken with a telephoto lens. He hadn't spotted the photographer. He's wearing a shortsleeve polo shirt and jeans, so it must have been taken months ago. The man was holding a cup of coffee, and exiting a coffee shop. The daily routine must have made it pretty easy for whoever was tailing him. The height of the shots put the photographer in a car across the street. The photos looked dim and hazy, even for a black and white shot.".

Section 8 - Guest Bedrooms

Nathan_Room is a room. The printed name is "Oak Room". It is east of the East_Hallway. The description is "The room had a large white rug in the center, and a four-poster bed that looked nice enough that it might have once sat in the master bedroom. An ugly, expensive-looking valise lay on the bed, its weight sinking it a full six inches into the feathertop mattress.".

Scott_Room is a room. The printed name is "Sumac Room". It is south of the East_Hallway.

Jan_Room is a room. The printed name is "Hemlock Room". It is north of the East_Hallway. The description is "The room had an angled ceiling to give the impression of a cozy attic or country cabin, except it was about as big as my entire apartment. Piles of climbing equipment and bunched-up coils of rope were heaped in the corner on top of his luggage. A gray sweater hung on a chair, flecks of dark reddish-brown stains dried on it.".
The sweater is scenery in the Jan_Room. The description is "It was a thick wool turtleneck, so big it looked like a blanket draped over the chair. Around the front and the sleeves, blood stains were visible where some had apparently splashed back onto it."

We have a few hours before what passes for the law for our kind shows up and starts stomping its flat feet around. They don't much care if the wrong one of us takes the rap, or if no one does. Alan's nobody to the Circle, I doubt they'd care if this case went stone cold. But he used to be a friend of mine, and this is something I want to do for him.[quotation mark]".

We've got ways to keep anyone from talking about it.[quotation mark][if Blood_status is true][paragraph break]Something inside me rebelled at the thought of it, my stomach churning. [quotation mark]I can't just take it, it could've been used to help someone![quotation mark][paragraph break][quotation mark]It is going to help someone: you. If someone from outside killed Alan, I need to know if he's likely to come back. If it was someone here, I need you on your toes.[end if]".

He used it to buy that ridiculous title, a couple of country estates, and even restored an old manor house. But a little time running with the Circle crowd will tell you that [quotation mark]old money[quotation mark] is a relative term.[quotation mark]".

Here was a woman who wasn't afraid to throw her weight around, and made it a bad habit to force her to do it.[paragraph break][quotation mark]Think of me as your first client as a private dick. I'm asking you to make this one on the house. You owe me, remember?[quotation mark][paragraph break]She had me there.

	The printed name is "why Nathaniel came here".
	The comment is "[quotation mark]So, do you come here often? I'm having trouble telling if this is a private party or a resort. Were you good friends with Alan?[quotation mark]".
	The reply is "[quotation mark]He was all right. Really, the house has nice position, and at the height of skiing season, it's hard to beat the crowd.[quotation mark] He gestured vaguely towards the surrounding countryside as though it were a buffet.".

	The comment is "[quotation mark]Where were you last night?[quotation mark]".
	The reply is "His lofty affected manner disappeared the second I asked. His smile was still fixed on his face, but the black eyes were suddenly cold and threatening. I met his gaze, unflinching. It felt like skinny dipping in Lake Ontario.[paragraph break][quotation mark]I don't know what the hell you think you're playing at, but let's get one thing straight.

	The reply is "[quotation mark]Jan? Jesus, I can't stand him. He's insufferable at every damn conference I run into him at.

	The reply is "He gave me a knowing smile that was not at all kind. [quotation mark]Did he already give you the sales pitch? He probably left out the part where he's lost good ten percent more than the indexes. That joke of a fund of his is bleeding money, it's not surprising he's trying to get new clients to keep things solvent.[quotation mark]".

who scott killer is a repeatable questioning quip.
	The printed name is "who he thinks did it".
	The comment is "'Who you figure got to Bowden before we got here?'".
	The reply is "The second I asked, he started shifting around like something was crawling under his skin. 'There's someone out there, you mark my words. Did you see the door? They knew he lived alone, broke in, and stabbed him, simple as that. You can bet I'm getting the hell out of here the second the sun sets. This is like Geneva all over again, I'm not ending up like those people!' His high voice was a whine now, the shrill panic of a man who didn't deal well with stress.".

Our people are connected enough in the media and the government to keep a tight lid on any leaks, but every so often, one person comes along who can slip through the net. He buried himself in the snow and found a vantage point on a house by Lake Geneva, a wealthy Patron was having a party. Anyone who tried to leave the house at night was picked off at fifty paces. Anyone who tried to run during the day... well, you can imagine.[paragraph break]The Inquisition made a big public show of the execution when they caught him.

We'll bounce back, and I'm not worried, nor are our high-profile clients.[quotation mark][paragraph break]It all sounded a little too well-rehearsed. I saw him give me a quick once over, it was almost imperceptible.[paragraph break][quotation mark]Now's the best time to buy in, when you consider the numbers. Do you know someone who'd be interested in an account with us? Your friend, Ms. Sinclair, perhaps?[quotation mark][line break]I chuckled politely and gave a noncommittal shrug.[line break][quotation mark]There'd be a finder's fee in it for you, of course, if things did move to business.

	The comment is "'You've met Val?'".
	The reply is "He looked surprised. 'Sure. Everybody knows Val. For someone who's been around as long as her, I'm surprised she hasn't tried her hand at politics. Just about all the other elders love their little backroom deals and power plays. She hasn't been very interested in becoming a Patron either. I think you're her first in some fifty years.'".

about patronage is a repeatable questioning quip.
	The printed name is "about Patronage".
	The comment is "'Patron?'".
	The reply is "He gave a hearty laugh that didn't endear me any more to him. 'Wow, I guess she's as tight-lipped as they say. Patronage is the flowery little euphemism for the way we expand our little Circle. I was told the term came from the aristocrats in the old days. You know, bring in an artist or a mathematician, someone of value, and preserve their genius for all time. And of course, the prestige that comes from having such a stable. A little trophy case to show off in front of the other elders.' He gave me a grin that made him look like an overgrown schoolboy. 'Well, that was the idea, anyway. In reality, Patrons have needs like anyone else. They'll bring in someone who can bring something practical to the table. Unique skills, money... love.' His grin was starting to look more like a leer.".

Through the window, I could see that lights were starting to come on in the distant houses dotted across the mountainside.[paragraph break]I wasn't sure how long I'd slept, but it must have been about eight o'clock in the evening.".

When Wakeup ends:
	remove Adrian_Investigation from play;

Section 1 - Adrian_Investigation

Adrian_Investigation is a man. The printed name is "Adrian". Understand "Adrian" as Adrian_Investigation. The description is "He stood well over six feet with a build that belonged on the inside of a steel cage. The designer charcoal suit he wore hadn’t quite been successfully altered to his wide frame. A deep purple tie sat at his neck in a fat knot Donald Trump would have approved of. The dark hair atop his head was neatly parted at the side, and slicked back almost flat to his head. His eyes were gray, and there was something baleful deep in them, peering out. His size and heavy brow made him look like a gorilla in Prada.[if Wakeup is happening][paragraph break]He introduced himself as 'Adrian Castillo, Deputy to the Warden of the Peace, appointed to serve at the pleasure of the Honorable Countess of Westchester.' I didn't know what most of that meant, but I knew his suit was a little too nice for a cop entirely on the level. I wondered if that all fit on his business card.".

Before saying hello to Adrian_Investigation:
	try examining Adrian_Investigation;
	continue the action.

[He was thirty-five and yet not.. He had the eyes of an old man bitter at the world and the look of a young boy pulling the wings off a butterfly. Here was someone who enjoyed pushing people with impunity, I'd bet money on it.]

	The comment is "[quotation mark]So am I a suspect here?[quotation mark]".
	The reply is "'Nah. I'm just going through the formalities, just in case. I just wanted to talk to everyone who had a personal connection with the guy. That leaves you off the hook. Not to mention the the alibi you left, according to your girlfriend.[line break]'Oh?'[line break]'Yeah, that twisted junk heap at the bottom of a cliff. They'll have a heck of a time towing that up. Anyway, if you were wandering out there a couple of hours ago, then there's no way you could get here at the time of death.

about questioning val is a repeatable questioning quip. It indirectly-follows about questioning me.
	The printed name is "about questioning val".
	The comment is "'I'm going to need you to come with me downstairs. I've got to ask Ms. Sinclair a few questions, and she asked you be present.' That confused me a bit. I wasn't entirely certain what Val and I were to each other, but I sure as hell wasn't her lawyer.".

	The reply is "'You've had a file for three weeks now.' I didn't like that. I didn't like it so much I could hardly think of a cute comeback to make. He seemed to enjoy lording over me the fact that he knew something that I didn't. It was probably a feeling he didn't get to enjoy very often.".
	It quip-supplies Adrian_Investigation.

about anyone outside is a repeatable questioning quip. It indirectly-follows about questioning val.
	The printed name is "about anyone outside".
	The comment is "'See anyone on your way in? A couple of guests seemed pretty spooked about the idea that the killer would come back, something about Lake Geneva.' I kept my voice smooth and casual, like I wasn't at all nervous about the idea of being game in somebody else's pheasant hunt.".
	The reply is "'Nope, all quiet out there.' Something in my face must've shown my silent vote of no confidence, since he tried to follow it up. 'Listen, punk. I've been in this business twice as long as you've been alive. If I don't see nobody out there, there ain't nobody.' I didn't tell him that that meant exactly jack and shit in my book. One look at him told me he didn't have an eye for detail. There's people on every force who can't think their way out of a wet paper bag, and I'd have bet my weight in cake donuts that Detective Castillo here was one of them.".

He didn't strike me as the sharpest tool in the shed, but he'd clearly learned where the line was. Staying in the good graces of his employer meant staying within the level of harassment his job warranted, and not ruffling the feathers of anyone too important in the Circle.[paragraph break]'You'll let me know if there's anything else I can do to help, Deputy?' she said icily. She hadn't bothered looking at him as she said it. She gave me a look full of meaning and left the room in the direction of the foyer, closing the door behind her.

Chapter 16 Second_Investigation

Players_Cluecar is a device. The printed name is "my car". Understand "my car" as Players_Cluecar. Understand "car" as Players_Cluecar.

Instead of examining the Players_Cluecar:
	say "The car I'd driven for close to the last hundred thousand miles, fender bent and windshield missing. I hadn't expected to have to look at it again, but if Val thought there was something here, that's the hunch I was going to play.[paragraph break]If I was going to find anything, I'd have to look through it piece by piece to figure out what happened. I started to feel detached from the place, like I'd never been there before. Start fresh, don't miss anything. I told myself to treat it like any other crime scene.[if the Players_Cluecar is switched on][paragraph break]The radio chattered away to nobody, muffled slightly by the sound of air flowing out of the heater.[end if]".

Rule for writing a paragraph about the Players_Cluecar:
	say "My Toyota Corolla in a fetching 'Regatta Blue' that must have looked appealing under bright dealership lights when it was brand new back in 1990. I wouldn't know. It now sat on its side like a beached whale, exactly where I'd left it. The key was still in the ignition.[if the Players_Cluecar is switched on] The power was on, and the dashboard blinked orange and red lights at me.[end if]".

the brake line is scenery. the brake line is a clue. the brake line is part of the Players_Cluecar. The description is "I put a hand behind the wheel and the suspension arm and felt along the metal tube of the brake line, nearly slicing my finger on a thin slit. It wasn't a bit of rust or metal fatigue, the cut was too clean. It might have been made by a dremel or a wire cutter. Cutting brake lines straight through would stop the front brakes from working. But a leak like this could take hours to affect performance. Whatever my state of mind or driving had been on that turn, this wasn't an accident.[paragraph break]The fact that I was able to see all of this without a flashlight barely registered.".

the dashboard is scenery. the dashboard is part of the Players_Cluecar. The description is "[if the Players_Cluecar is switched off]The car was off, the dashboard only showed dust and smudgy fingerprints. I hadn't been a big believer in car washing.[end if][if the Players_Cluecar is switched on]I scanned the panel, and saw a red indicator I'd never seen lit before. The brake light.[end if]".

the brakes are scenery in the Bottom of Cliff. The description is "The rotors were pretty worn, and a little rusty, but they were too expensive to replace as often as they say.".

Carry out examining the brakes:

		stop the action;

the tires are scenery in the Bottom of Cliff.
the cluecar_windshield is scenery. The cluecar_windshield is part of the Player_Cluecar. The printed name is "windshield". Understand "windshield" as cluecar_windshield. The description is "The windshield lay on the ground where I'd kicked it out, already dusted with an inch of fresh snow.".

the tires are scenery in the Bottom of Cliff.
the wheels are scenery in the Bottom of Cliff.

instead of switching on the Players_Cluecar:
	say "I leaned into the cabin through the hole left by the windshield and turned the key. The headlights flicked on, and the dashboard lit up. I heard the radio bleat into the empty forest, muffled by the dull roar of air pouring out of the A/C vents. The engine turned over but didn't start. The inertia switch had cut off fuel to the engine when the car rolled down the hill. I didn't really mind, I hadn't planned on driving it out of here.";
	now the Players_Cluecar is switched on.
	
instead of switching off the Players_Cluecar:
	say "At this point, there was no harm in letting the battery drain. It was going to get hauled off anyway.";

Rule for writing a paragraph about the Players_Cluecar:
	if the brake line is examined:
		say "I took one last look at the wreck of my old car, it'd told me everything it could. It was stupid, but for the first time I felt a little bad leaving it abandoned here. The old bucket had been with me a long time. That's sentimentalism, I suppose.";
	otherwise:
		say "I walked over to the car and crouched down beside it to look for clues. There had to be something to tell me if Val's hunch was right or not."

When VillainMonologue ends:
	say "His eyes went wild, and for a moment I felt like I could actually see his nerves fray and snap. His upper lip curled back over bared teeth so far it looked inhuman. It was the yellow-eyed look of a wolf baring its fangs. He was no wolf, but maybe he was so livid, he'd just forgotten. He whirled the gun around to point it straight at Val's serene face, and pulled the trigger. Her head was nowhere near the gun when it went off. She'd ducked to the side faster than I'd seen anyone move before, like Mayweather slipping a punch.[paragraph break]When Scott tried to aim the gun at her this time, screaming an unearthly scream, her hands were already up in a blur. She let him get another shot off, which I thought was pretty charitable of her. There was nothing resembling charity in her green eyes, burning with a cold fury. It seemed for a second like she'd disarmed him as the gun dropped to the floor. It took an eternity to fall. Then I noticed in the dim light of the wine cellar a glint of silver attached to his neck, a small knife labeled with the initials 'AHB.' His empty hands went to his throat, and he crumpled over. We listened to quiet gasping for a minute as Val came over to untie me from the chair. By the time she'd finished, it had stopped.".

Every turn during VillainMonologue:
	If the number of available quips which are not recollected by Scott_Villain is 1:

how he planned on getting away is a questioning quip. The printed name is "how he planned on getting away".
	The comment is "You seriously plan to just kill us and get out of here?".
	The reply is "It'll be easy. A house full of corpses turned to ash, I can just make sure it looks like mine is among them. I disappear, and start over with a new life. It's easy enough to pull off, we all have to do it every fifty years or so. No one will come looking for me, we'll just be tragic victims of some rogue hunter.

[line break]'So where we headed?'[line break]'What was the last time you were in Vegas?' We got in and I started the car.[paragraph break]We started off down the road and we began to talk, really talk, for the first time since I'd met her.

Forgive my sudden request, but I really don't know where else to turn. A few months ago, I received a series of threatening letters from an anonymous individual demanding payment. I can't go into the details here, but suffice it to say that I gave in to the threats, and attempted to find a sum that this person would settle for. Recently, things took a turn for the worse, and I can't possibly hope to pay the amount of money he's asking for. Please, I need you to find who this is, and scare them off, or something, and I need it done quietly. The matter is very delicate, and not the sort of thing I could take to the police in the first place. I'm having my one of my usual Christmas gatherings, you can come up here then, and we'll discuss it. In case this person is watching me, it shouldn't attract any suspicion if you come here with others.[line break]Sincerely,[line break]Alan"	make blackmail known rule

Even after so many years of teaching in this field, I love seeing a class of fresh new faces, and the enthusiasm and ideas with which you tackle this material. More than just having you read journals and criticism, my goal this semester is to teach you to think critically, and how to hone your own ideas about some of the world's oldest classics. For some of you, this will be a time to get your feet wet in a different literary tradition than you're used to. I look forward to an enjoyable semester together! For your reference, the syllabus may be found at the following intranet link.[line break]Regards,[EmailSignature]"	--
