- TODO Later: Make one that gets none, compare
- TODO: Instead of talking to Val during discovery, custom message and then she leaves

- MAKE SPECIAL EVENTS IN BOLD, SO PEOPLE DON"T MISS THEM?

- Let Adrian go down first when the player goes south in the hallway, have a line about "don't keep me waiting too long"
================================

Necessary for game to work / work better

- TODO: Pool of wine should be a struggle clue
- TODO: Fallen book should be a struggle clue


=================================

Critical impact on experience

- TODO: Quip-suggestion phrase in normal game, interrogation, and talking to self
- TODO: Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions
- TODO: Add (press any key) when necessary
- TODO: Game hint depending on scene/scene status
- TODO: Change I beg your pardon message
- TODO Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.

=================================


==================================

Bugs



==================================

Won't Fix / No time to implement

- Drinking blood (optional) will give heightened senses and make solving puzzles easier.
- TODO: Sensible messages for getting in car
- Emails list full of boring student crap, need to key off the initials from book
- Getting into a knife fight is a bad proposition. The loser dies in the street, the winner gets to die in the hospital.

Low priority:
- Some kind of freaking map
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery

- Add stage direction type sentences to the beginning of paragraphs

- [TODO: Get on bed as a nice to have]


- [ BUG: Sleepy message persists even after waking up]
- [ BuG: I need to use indirectly-follows instead of an availability rule]
- bug: change "he could have ask" phrase outside of interrogation
- bug: Move interrogation npcs to room before scene change not after so there's not a slack turn
- bug: going to the precipice after the initial scene should not result in gameover

===============

Critical path

- Gloves
- Make the front door have a dummy item examining it also examines, and have that be a clue?
- MAKE SURE ALL CLUES HAVE A TABLE ENTRY FOR HINTS
- Val conversation leading to car revisit
	- What did you find? (clue context sensitive)
- Car revisit scene now has clues in it
- Wall safe stuff, more clues
	- Cash for blackmail, put comment in final scene for it
- Emails need to have clue rules when you read them
- When get back, split up with Val, sun rises again
- vdet gets hit wth light, go to investigate
- get hit on the head upon discovering it
- wake up in wine cellar, climax scene

- denouement, discussion with Val, leave in car

======================

Needs revision


- Finish interrogation
- Finish email text
