- Change the intro to prearrival and guest arrival
    - Prearrival, Val says she'll look around the house.
        - TODO it would be nice to give Val actual pathing, but this is really just a nice to have
    - Guest arrival she introduces the PC to the suspects so their names are all known.
        - Maybe give the player a few turns to look at them then send them to their rooms.

- Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever
- Drinking blood (optional) will give heightened senses and make solving puzzles easier.
- Make sure the need to talk to Val and wait, and so on is properly signposted
- Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions

- Clues list when player types hint

- Emails list full of boring student crap, need to key off the initials from book
- Getting into a knife fight is a bad proposition. The loser dies in the street, the winner gets to die in the hospital.

Low priority:
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.
