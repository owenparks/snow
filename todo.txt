- Let Adrian go down first when the player goes south in the hallway, have a line about "don't keep me waiting too long"


==================================

Bugs

- Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever

- Lots of double spaces throughout.


==================================

Nice to have

- Prearrival, Val says she'll look around the house.
    - TODO it would be nice to give Val actual pathing, but this is really just a nice to have

- Drinking blood (optional) will give heightened senses and make solving puzzles easier.
- Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions
- TODO: Sensible messages for getting in car
- TODO: Change I beg your pardon message

- Emails list full of boring student crap, need to key off the initials from book
- Getting into a knife fight is a bad proposition. The loser dies in the street, the winner gets to die in the hospital.

Low priority:
- Some kind of freaking map
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.

- Add stage direction type sentences to the beginning of paragraphs

- [TODO: Get on bed as a nice to have]


- [ BUG: Sleepy message persists even after waking up]
- [ BuG: I need to use indirectly-follows instead of an availability rule]
- bug: change "he could have ask" phrase outside of interrogation
- bug: Move interrogation npcs to room before scene change not after so there's not a slack turn
- bug: going to the precipice after the initial scene should not result in gameover

===============

Critical path

- Gloves
- Make the front door have a dummy item examining it also examines, and have that be a clue?
- MAKE SURE ALL CLUES HAVE A TABLE ENTRY FOR HINTS
- Val conversation leading to car revisit
	- What did you find? (clue context sensitive)
- Car revisit scene now has clues in it
- Wall safe stuff, more clues
	- Cash for blackmail, put comment in final scene for it
- Emails need to have clue rules when you read them
- When get back, split up with Val, sun rises again
- vdet gets hit wth light, go to investigate
- get hit on the head upon discovering it
- wake up in wine cellar, climax scene

- denouement, discussion with Val, leave in car

======================

Needs revision


- Finish interrogation
- Finish email text
