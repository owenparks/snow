- Send everyone to their rooms, write room descriptions
- Add a reason why everyone is there:
- Write an intro speech for Val
- Wall clock shows the time as it finishes, creating locked from the outside.
- Dialogue for first_investigation
    - Nathan
    - Jan
    - Scott
- Arrival of VDet
    - Val's Interrogation
- (More time for investigation, emails, maybe password lock prevents this?, give player password on Day 2)
    - Emails
    - Master Bedroom, book on nightstand, uncracked spine
- Sleep again
- Storm breaks
- Sunrise kills VDet
- Go investigate car
- Get back, collect final number of clues
    - Once player collects enough, trigger final scene
- Player wins final scene, you win

- Change the intro to prearrival and guest arrival
    - Prearrival, Val says she'll look around the house.
        - TODO it would be nice to give Val actual pathing, but this is really just a nice to have

- Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever
- Drinking blood (optional) will give heightened senses and make solving puzzles easier.
- Make sure the need to talk to Val and wait, and so on is properly signposted
- Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions

- Clues list when player types hint

- Emails list full of boring student crap, need to key off the initials from book
- Getting into a knife fight is a bad proposition. The loser dies in the street, the winner gets to die in the hospital.

Low priority:
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.
