CRITICAL Fix before release

- Scott needs entrance scene
- "could have asked message" needs fixing in all cases
- Make combination to safe, and safe opens if combination is examined (absentminded professor)

- TODO: Convert interrogation quips to playing automatically.

============================

Necessary for game to work / work better

- TODO: Fallen book should be a struggle clue

=================================

Critical impact on experience

- TODO: Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions
- TODO: Change I beg your pardon message
- TODO Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever

==================================

Bugs

==================================

Won't Fix / No time to implement

Low priority:
- bug: change "he could have ask" phrase outside of interrogation
- bug: going to the precipice after the initial scene should not result in gameover
- saying ask by itself

===============
