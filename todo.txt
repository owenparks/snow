==================================

Nice to have

- Prearrival, Val says she'll look around the house.
    - TODO it would be nice to give Val actual pathing, but this is really just a nice to have

- Drinking blood (optional) will give heightened senses and make solving puzzles easier.
- Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions

- Emails list full of boring student crap, need to key off the initials from book
- Getting into a knife fight is a bad proposition. The loser dies in the street, the winner gets to die in the hospital.

Low priority:
- Some kind of freaking map
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.

- [TODO: Get on bed as a nice to have]


- [ BUG: Sleepy message persists even after waking up]
- [ BuG: I need to use indirectly-follows instead of an availability rule]
- bug: Move interrogation npcs to room before scene change not after so there's not a slack turn
