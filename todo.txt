CRITICAL Fix before release

- Scott needs entrance scene
- Clues need to be in the freaking table
- "could have asked message" needs fixing in all cases

- TODO: Convert interrogation quips to playing automatically.

===========================

Scenery stuff:
-- Not much seems to clue the clue that you need to DRIVE to keep going.
-- You can't EXAMINE THE CAR, for one thing, nor try to GET OUT.
-- Room description mentions radio tuned to some news station; LISTEN does nothing.

-- OPEN BELT should be a synonym for UNBUCKLE BELT.
-- OUT and other attempts at going give an uninformative response.
-- Car doors missing a description.

Foyer:
-- No "snow" object
-- No "rug" object

Greatroom:
-- Again, mention of a radio but no response to LISTEN.
-- No description of the sofa
-- Examining the stain after finding the wineglass still hints that it's there
-- No response for EXAMINE FLOOR or other attempts at finding the reflective thing mentioned by the stain
-- No exits in room description



============================
DONE

- disable "what"

============================

- TODO Later: Make one that gets none, compare

================================

Necessary for game to work / work better

- TODO: Fallen book should be a struggle clue

=================================

Critical impact on experience

- TODO: Add descriptions for scenery obviously listed in room descriptions
- TODO: Add (press any key) when necessary
- TODO: Game hint depending on scene/scene status
- TODO: Change I beg your pardon message
- TODO Fix fucking topics double printing and having wrong tenses or whatever
- Examine self, you know people are going to do that shit and complain.

=================================


==================================

Bugs

==================================

Won't Fix / No time to implement

Low priority:
- Some kind of freaking map
- Add scenery to all the mountain areas, add them to region I guess
- Clock in the vals_car scenery

- Add stage direction type sentences to the beginning of paragraphs

- [ BuG: I need to use indirectly-follows instead of an availability rule]
- bug: change "he could have ask" phrase outside of interrogation
- bug: going to the precipice after the initial scene should not result in gameover

===============

Critical path

- Gloves
- Make the front door have a dummy item examining it also examines, and have that be a clue?
- Wall safe stuff, more clues
	- Cash for blackmail, put comment in final scene for it
- Emails need to have clue rules when you read them
