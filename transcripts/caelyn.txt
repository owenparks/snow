Mountain Road
They say you shouldn't drive when you're angry. That was just one of a hundred pieces of good advice I was ignoring as I drove north along the icy road to the chalet, my foot a little heavier on the gas than it needed to be.

I'd had a long, promising career in homicide ahead of me, or so I kept telling myself, and it was all down the drain now. I had planned on a senior detective's desk being in the cards for me, at least. Maybe even quitting and going into private investigations. Well, I guessed I could still do that.

Not six hours earlier, I'd turned in my badge and my gun and walked out, more or less the way I'd seen it in the movies. The captain was yelling his head off, couldn't figure out why a promising young detective like me would just up and quit. I honestly hoped he never did.

Mountain Pass
I had the radio on tuned to some news station-- truth be told, I already missed the chatter of the dispatch as I was driving. The traffic report had little bearing on my current locale, but the weather gave me some concern: a snowstorm coming up off the Great Lakes, apparently. Spending the weekend with a small crowd I barely knew appealed very little to me. Being cooped up with them the entire time due to weather seemed like a recipe for an epidemic of cabin fever.

Hairpin Turn
If I'd finished that last thought a few seconds earlier, I might've noticed the caution sign for the sharp turn, barely visible through the snow. The car was going too fast, and the guardrail came out of nowhere.

>stop
I hit the brakes, but the car kept straight for the guardrail, slamming through, and going over.

The back end of the car lost traction and swung out wide, trying vainly to follow the front, just like one of those car commercials. Unfortunately, I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course, and the right side of the car went over the edge of the cliff, momentum then taking the rest of the car with it. In shock, my brain couldn't manage to tell my body to do more than grip the wheel uselessly as the car tumbled down the steep incline. I lost count of the rolls after three. The roof hit a tree, and I was jerked upward against the seat belt. Snow from the branches fell in a pile onto the passenger window from the impact. I heard a thud, snuffing out the brief glimpse of moonlight. Everything went black.

Upturned Car
I wasn't sure how long I'd been out. Taking stock of my situation, I was surprised to find myself more or less unhurt, save for a dull ache in my left wrist where I'd tried to brace against the door. I took a few deep breaths, and tried to gather myself-- I was still a little mentally unfocused.

The car was currently lying at the bottom of a cliff on its side. Above me, I could dimly see the light of the moon, mottled by the snow on the passenger side windows. The windshield in front of me showed nothing but evergreen forest, extending into the darkness.

I was still strapped in, the seat belt made sure I stayed put. At least one thing in this car still knew how to do its job right.

>unbuckle
I wrestled with the jammed seat belt for a moment, then managed to undo it, falling a few inches down against the driver door once the chest belt was free.

>open door

You seem to want to talk to someone, but I can't see whom.

>kick windshield
Bracing my back against the sideways seat, I gave the windshield a couple of sharp kicks. I felt the seal start to give, and then it dislodged entirely from the frame, making an exit. It fell out onto the snow with a muffled crunch, and the bitter wind started to blow into the old car. I pulled my coat tight around me, and stepped out into the forest.

Bottom of Cliff
I stood on a ridge densely packed with trees some ways below the highway. My wrecked car sat a few feet away. The ridge extended as far as I could see to the north, going nowhere in particular. To the west I saw the steep incline the car had rolled down, and the path it'd cut through the snow and brush.

Sharp Bend
I walked on the snowy road about a hundred feet from the hairpin turn where my car had gone over; I could see the tire tracks and broken guardrail to the east.

The second I turned my head to look down the lane, I saw a pair of headlights approach. A black Mercedes pulled up and came to a stop just in front of me. The timing was a little unnerving. The passenger door opened, and I saw Val looking out at me.

"Get in," she said.

Sedan
The inside of the Mercedes was yards of brushed metal and hand-stitched leather. It still smelled new. Having run out of things to talk about, I had nothing to do but wait for us to arrive.

Val drove the car, her eyes looking miles beyond the road, the mountains, and the horizon.

The first thing I noticed were the dark green eyes, clear even driving down a street with no lights. She looked to be in her thirties, but she could have been three hundred for all I knew. Her face shone in the moonlight, pale and beautiful and unnatural. She was wearing too-red lipstick, which gave her the look of a Venetian mask. Wavy auburn hair framed a face I wouldn't have kicked out of bed for eating crackers.

Driveway
We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val got out of the car and took her bag out of the trunk.

"Come on, I'll introduce you to Alan," she said, walking up the drive.

Front Porch
Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

The front door stood open.

There was something about the door that looked like a B&E job.

>x door
A large wooden door, painted white as a preacher's picket fence. It didn't have a window or peephole. Something seemed odd about the lock, like it had been damaged. There was splintered wood on the side of the doorframe where someone had apparently forced the door open.

I peered at the window next to the door. It looked to be double or triple pane glass. Crouching down slightly, I saw a recessed mechanism for a metal shutter door, almost like a security gate. Presumably, upon activation, it would slam down and block entry.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences.

A layer of snow had blown in through the open doorway, and was slowly melting into a puddle on the enormous Persian rug.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade. Coming from somewhere up there I heard "O Come, All Ye Faithful" warbling from what sounded like an old radio.

I looked at the plush carpet, checking it for footprints. A shoe size can be pretty damn circumstantial, but at this point, I needed every clue I could get.

I didn't see one, it was just as pristine as the drifts of snow in the valley below.

But something caught my eye, something small and sharp, glinting in the light of the room as I walked the perimeter of the rug. A shard of glass by the edge of the sofa.

Reading Nook
I climbed the stairs to the reading nook. Shelves lined the walls of the small room, and a couple of books had been knocked off them onto the floor. A pair of wingback armchairs faced each other with a coffee table in between. A small pool of red liquid lay underneath the table.

A man sat in one, slightly paunchy and slightly grey, his eyes and mouth wide open. His glasses were askew. He was wearing a navy blue cardigan, stained all over the front with a dark, almost black liquid. What looked like a small knife was sticking out of his neck, plunged in so far that only the handle was visible.

An antique wooden radio sat on the table, playing Christmas carols.

I could also see a bottle of wine and a wineglass here.

It looked like a silver letter opener with an ivory handle. A monogram on the end read "AHB". It didn't look that long or that sharp, but someone had made a pretty clean business of stabbing Bowden with it. Or maybe they'd just gotten lucky. It happens like that sometimes.

Turn Count: 40

>x corpse
He looked like he was fifty, but something about his well-preserved look told me that he was probably sixty. It wasn't that he was in good shape-- I doubted he'd seen much real exercise since he was in high school, and maybe not even then. He struck me as a debate team sort of guy. I could tell he didn't get out much. His fingers were broad, but smooth. His hands had no calluses and no rings, but he wore a Rolex watch. It wasn't fake, and had cost probably three times what my car was worth before I'd driven it off a cliff a few hours ago.

Val came up the stairs, freezing the second she saw the body. Her eyes narrowed, and I could tell her mind was racing, the first time I'd seen anything but placid boredom on her face. Half of me was relieved to know that there was something in this world that could perturb her. The other half was unnerved by it. She looked away and hitched the poker face back on pretty quick.

Val nodded at the poor stiff and said, "Meet Professor Alan Bowden, our host this weekend."

Three men stood on the rug, their coats and pant cuffs damp with snow. Val made introductions all around, as if nothing was wrong. 

I studied their faces carefully. If one of them knew about Alan upstairs, they weren't letting on. The three men were overdressed for vacation, as rich men often are. But somehow, they were oddly mismatched. I doubted that they came here together.

The sideswept brown locks and pencil mustache were meant to look youthful and sporty, like he'd just stopped playing cricket for teatime. The lines on the face and brow made him look more Vincent Price than Errol Flynn, though. I could tell by the way he stood that he didn't have a care in the world, or at least I wasn't one of them. His half-lidded stare gave him an air of casual arrogance, like he was perpetually waiting for the valet to bring his car around.

Scott Gage, on the other hand, was tall and lanky, and didn't seem at all suited to the cold. He wore a pair of Japanese selvedge jeans with the cuffs turned up to make sure everyone knew it. I'd have guessed he'd picked them up somewhere in SoHo if it weren't for the sweater he was wearing, useless against real cold, as all Californian sweaters are.

>x jan
Jan Svennson was a broad-shouldered man with pale blue eyes. He was casually brushing snow off a European performance fleece sweater. Either he liked ice climbing, or he wanted people to think he did. He had the handshake of a salesman and the grin of a frat boy.

Val waited a minute for the conversations the three were having to die down.
(Press a key)She folded her arms across her chest and took a deep breath quiet enough that only I heard it.

"Gentlemen, we have a problem. Alan's dead. We found him upstairs, stabbed."

A stunned silence followed. When it was clear no one was going to break it, she went on. "I'm going to call it in to the New York Magistrate's and find out who isn't on vacation that they can send over." She lifted a hand, exposing her pale wrist enough to read the face of her watch. "It's going to be at least six hours before they can send someone, and they'll have to make it through what's left of the winter storm. Until we can figure out exactly what happened and who's responsible, I suggest we all stay in our rooms. My associate here has some experience with police investigation, he can do the basics until the officials show up."

Nathaniel seemed to bristle at this. "Hang on a minute, wait in our rooms? Am I to take it you're presuming us suspects? How do I know you and your friend didn't just kill Alan?"

Val shrugged and pointed at me. "It happens that my friend here is the only one of us with a solid alibi, unless I'm mistaken."

The lack of a response indicated that she wasn't, which bothered me a little. The three picked up their bags and trundled down the hall, varying degrees of insulted, Jan called back in a raised voice. "You're making a big mistake. Don't you remember what happened at Lake Geneva in 1986? I think there's someone out there who got Alan, and now we're sitting ducks."

He said it with false bravado, and I shouldn't have let the idea take root in my mind, but it did.

Foyer
I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the large lacquered wood screens in front of the door. The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 


I could also see Val here.

With no more sound than a loud whisper, shutters slid down on the inside of every window in the house. They looked like opaque fabric window shades, but the heavy sound of the seal told me the core was probably metal. The light from outside went out as suddenly as if someone had thrown a curtain over the moon.

"Seems like a pretty long way to stick my neck out for you. What's in it for me, exactly?"

She gave me a sharp look. I could tell it got a lot of use, it was just as practiced as everything else about her. Here was a woman who wasn't afraid to throw her weight around, and made it a bad habit to force her to do it.

"Think of me as your first client as a private dick. I'm asking you to make this one on the house. You owe me, remember?"

She had me there. I didn't know if this was the kind of thing I could pay back, but I didn't like owing that kind of debt.

Val leaned in close until her face was inches from mine, and lowered her voice, even though no one was around. "Listen, kid. Here's how it's going down. We have a few hours before what passes for the law for our kind shows up and starts stomping its flat feet around. They don't much care if the wrong one of us takes the rap, or if no one does. Alan's nobody to the Circle, I doubt they'd care if this case went stone cold. But he used to be a friend of mine, and this is something I want to do for him."

"I guess. He made a sizeable fortune selling boots to the Allies during World War I, a real war profiteer. He used it to buy that ridiculous title, a couple of country estates, and even restored an old manor house. But a little time running with the Circle crowd will tell you that "old money" is a relative term."

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. A fire roared inside, fresh logs having been added not too long ago.

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade.

I could see a glass shard and a broken wineglass here.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Professor,
When I got to the registration system it said the class was full, even though there appear to be slots open in the listing. I wasn't able to contact anyone at the registrar's office, can you help me? I need to take this class for my major.
Thanks,
Melissa Chung

Hi Professor Bowden,
I was wondering if you'd be willing to write me a recommendation for a graduate program I'll be applying to in a few months. I hope you've been happy with my work TAing the 200 level classes, and I'd be happy to give more specifics about my interests if that would help. The deadline for the submission is in a few months. I look forward to hearing back from you.
Thanks,
 Hilary Chanthavong

All,
I'd like to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving, please take some time off to relax and spend it with family. For those of you who are traveling home, have a safe journey. For those of you who are not able to, I'm hosting Thanksgiving dinner at my home, and all are welcome to attend. There's a great view of the lake, and I promise excellent food, drink, and company.
Happy Holidays,

Hi Frank,
We have a guest speaker coming in to give a talk about historical architecture in Kyoto. I thought I'd give you guys a heads up in case your department or any of your students had an interest in that. I think her talk might be a little light on the history and heavy on the architecture, so just be aware of that. It's this Wednesday at 6pm in the Weber Hall auditorium, light refreshments to follow.

Alex,
It seems like the photocopy machine in the Asian Studies department office is low on toner, who do I talk to about getting that replaced?
Thanks,

Hi Linda,
A couple of students in my class were trying to register past the add deadline, and said there was an error accessing the online system, is this indeed the case? Let me know if you anticipate any problems doing a manual add.
Thanks,

Class,
I've already received several questions about the homework and date of the final exam, which as I've already stated, is in the course syllabus, which is available at the intranet link I mentioned in class. The syllabus already has the date of the midterm and final exam, as well as the grading policy for the entire semester listed in detail. I regret that I will not be able to answer any further questions to which the answers are already available.
Regards,

Class,
As you may have heard, my name is Alan Bowden, and I'll be teaching Intro to Asian Literature 201, as I do every fall. Even after so many years of teaching in this field, I love seeing a class of fresh new faces, and the enthusiasm and ideas with which you tackle this material. More than just having you read journals and criticism, my goal this semester is to teach you to think critically, and how to hone your own ideas about some of the world's oldest classics. For some of you, this will be a time to get your feet wet in a different literary tradition than you're used to. I look forward to an enjoyable semester together! For your reference, the syllabus may be found at the following intranet link.
Regards,
--

>x cups
Mugs of coffee, stone cold. I could see rings on the sides of the half-empty cups where the liquid had evaporated. They'd been here a few days, but that didn't indicate a time of death. The kind of man who leaves more than two coffee cups sitting on a desk isn't in a hurry to clean up after himself.

>x desk
Unlike most of the other expensive furniture in the house, it looked like the mahogany desk got a lot of use. A computer at least five years old, sat on it, the keyboard mostly buried by papers and books. Worn brass handles barely hung on to a row of drawers along the right side.

>* Bullets could use a description

>x statement
A bank statement detailing transactions for the past 6 months. Most of it is purchases of home furnishings and luxury goods. A couple of withdrawals stand out as having too many zeroes. Alan had made some large bank transfers every month to a foreign bank, and then one last cash withdrawal for the balance of the account. He'd needed liquid capital fast, which seemed a little odd for someone who seemed to be so financially stable.

I thumbed through the pile on the desk, finding term papers and dissertations, collections of academic journals. Underneath most of it was something that caught my eye, a document with dollar signs on it and more zeroes than I'm used to seeing on paper.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

I was starting to feel tired. Everything that had happened in the past few days was finally starting to take its toll. I thought it might help to find a bedroom and sleep for a few hours.

Upstairs Hallway
I stood in a normal-sized hallway that seemed cramped compared to the dimensions of the rest of the house. The hardwood floor was just as polished as the one downstairs. To the east were a couple of the smaller rooms clearly intended for overnight guests. To the north was another bedroom, and a set of double doors that led to the master suite.

I thought about the three men I'd just met, and how I liked none of them.

I changed into my pajamas and got into bed under the covers. I kept a reasonable distance between the two of us on the bed, though she didn't seem the type to get prudish about that kind of thing. I lay there thinking for a long time, trying to put together everything I'd heard into a picture that made sense. After five minutes that took two hours, I fell asleep, and dreamt of nothing.

I awoke to an empty room, bathed in the silver moonlight. She hadn't made a sound when she'd left. It took a second for me to realize that the shutters had gone back up. Through the window, I could see that lights were starting to come on in the distant houses dotted across the mountainside.

He stood well over six feet with a build that belonged on the inside of a steel cage. The designer charcoal suit he wore hadn't quite been successfully altered to his wide frame. A deep purple tie sat at his neck in a fat knot Donald Trump would have approved of. The dark hair atop his head was neatly parted at the side, and slicked back almost flat to his head. His eyes were gray, and there was something baleful deep in them, peering out. His size and heavy brow made him look like a gorilla in Prada.

He introduced himself as "Adrian Castillo, Deputy to the Warden of the Peace, appointed to serve at the pleasure of the Honorable Countess of Westchester." I didn't know what most of that meant, but I knew his suit was a little too nice for a cop entirely on the level. I wondered if that all fit on his business card.

"Oh?"
"Yeah, that twisted junk heap at the bottom of a cliff. They'll have a heck of a time towing that up. Anyway, if you were wandering out there a couple of hours ago, then there's no way you could get here at the time of death.

"See anyone on your way in? A couple of guests seemed pretty spooked about the idea that the killer would come back, something about Lake Geneva." I kept my voice smooth and casual, like I wasn't at all nervous about the idea of being game in somebody else's pheasant hunt.

"Nope, all quiet out there." Something in my face must've shown my silent vote of no confidence, since he tried to follow it up. "Listen, punk. I've been in this business twice as long as you've been alive. If I don't see nobody out there, there ain't nobody." I didn't tell him that that meant exactly jack and shit in my book. One look at him told me he didn't have an eye for detail. There's people on every force who can't think their way out of a wet paper bag, and I'd have bet my weight in cake donuts that Deputy Castillo here was one of them.

Staying in the good graces of his employer meant staying within the level of harassment his job warranted, and not ruffling the feathers of anyone too important in the Circle.

"You'll let me know if there's anything else I can do to help, Deputy?" she said icily. She hadn't bothered looking at him as she said it.

Cutting brake lines straight through would stop the front brakes from working entirely. But a leak like this could take hours to affect performance.

The shiny black surfaces were decorated with an intricate picture in gold paint, depicting a Chinese court scene. It seemed at odds with the exterior of the house, but matched the rest of the decor; the interior was a mixture of Old World furniture and Asian influences. 


I hadn't realized it until I saw an edge of light blue on the horizon, but we'd cut things pretty close again. A quiet whirring of the closing shutters and a click of the lock was the only indication that the sun was about to rise. The foyer went artificially dark again, except for the light of the brass chandelier.

Greatroom
The greatroom was clearly where the occupants of the house were meant to spend the majority of their time. Tall, dark wooden rafters criscrossed the high ceiling, the exposed beams clearly meant to evoke a Swiss chalet.

A large set of sofas were arranged around a huge rug. A dark wine stain was conspicuous on the armrest, standing out on the white fabric. Everything in the room faced a gray slate fireplace. 

A small spiral staircase in the corner led up to a reading nook, which was open to the greatroom, separated by a wooden balustrade.

I could see a glass shard and a broken wineglass here.

Downstairs Hallway
A long narrow corridor connected the entrance of the house with the bedrooms. Lights were recessed into the ceiling overhead, shining down onto the polished wood floor. Maybe some people liked this sterile modern crap, but it made the place look like an art gallery, as far as I was concerned. A couple of paintings even adorned the walls, so maybe that was the idea, and I was just uncultured.

Through the stillness of the house, I heard yelling upstairs. It started as a panicked cry of shock and surprise, but quickly turned to screams of agony. It went on, loud and incoherent, muffled by the wooden walls of the house, getting more raspy and strangled, like a pillow smothering a face. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped. I felt a lump in my stomach like a lead weight, and reached for where my shoulder holster used to be for a gun that wasn't there.

Upstairs Hallway
I stood in a normal-sized hallway that seemed cramped compared to the dimensions of the rest of the house. The hardwood floor was just as polished as the one downstairs. To the east were a couple of the smaller rooms clearly intended for overnight guests. To the north was another bedroom, and a set of double doors that led to the master suite.

Wine Cellar
 A wine rack ran the perimeter of the room, holding enough bottles to supply a French restaurant. A few seemed to be missing here and there. A wooden chair sat in the corner.

In the corner was a fuse box, partially obscured by shelves.

I was so focused on trying to read the labels on the fuse box that I didn't notice the footsteps behind me. Maybe I wouldn't have anyway. I heard a dull crack and realized it was the sound of a heavy bottle hitting the back of my head. It was the last thing I remembered thinking about before the rush of unconsciousness. I was out before I hit the floor.

I woke up with a headache like I'd kissed the Long Island Express goodnight. When I tried to put my hands up to feel the back of my head, they jerked against ropes tying them to the chair, along with my legs. He'd gotten the drop on me, that was for sure.

Well, I was in pretty deep now. I looked around the dark room. No one to talk to but myself for the moment.

There were two wineglassesand an expensive bottle of wine that once sat on that table in the reading nook. Alan had known whoever it was well enough, or wanted to impress them enough to warrant opening a bottle of Bordeaux.

Why had that particular murder weapon been used? He hadn't been stabbed with a knife, he'd been stabbed by his own letter opener, the initials proved that. Whoever had stabbed him hadn't planned to. It seemed pretty farfetched that someone would drive all the way here with the express purpose of killing a man, and trust finding a letter opener to do it with.

Alan and his visitor were apparently having civilized conversation and drinking their wine for some time, judging by the state of the bottle. Then suddenly, a struggle had broken out. One wineglass got knocked over onto the floor, another went over the railing into the living room and under the sofa. And of course, Alan's assailant won the struggle.

That part got under my skin more than the rest of it. It almost seemed entirely unrelated and oddly personal. Someone hadn't wanted me here. But to all of these people, I was nobody until yesterday. Even then, I might've just been some guest Val brought along. I could think of another reason it might be advantageous to not have a cop at the house: they were the one blackmailing Alan.

The scratches on the lock and damage to the front door frame were a nice touch. Anyone responding to the house would think the killer had broken in, that it was someone Alan hadn't known. Alan hadn't been alone, and it was someone he'd known for a long time. On top of all that, it didn't add up that someone would go through all that trouble to break in and kill Alan, and end up doing it with a letter opener that happened to be lying around.

Wine Cellar
Scott had me dead to rights. The overhead lights in the cellar made his brow and nose cast long shadows down his face. Even so, I could tell his eyes burned with hate and bitterness. It wasn't all for me. He'd formed himself from a shy nerd into a the confidence man who gave TED talks and blithely took the venture capital thrown at him. But every day of it had been a tremendous effort. I saw it now that years of simmering hatred had stripped it away, down to the bone.

None of that mattered now. I was in his way, and whatever plan he'd come here with had unravelled spectacularly. If I didn't talk fast, I wasn't making it out of this basement. I wasn't sure if anyone was still home, or still alive. Maybe someone would hear if I yelled. I didn't want to try it unless I knew for sure that help would come; that's really only a trick that works once.

In the corner was a fuse box, partially obscured by shelves.

It'll be easy. A house full of corpses turned to ash, I can just make sure it looks like mine is among them. I disappear, and start over with a new life. It's easy enough to pull off, we all have to do it every fifty years or so. No one will come looking for me, we'll just be tragic victims of some rogue hunter. I take care of you and the lady, open all the shutters, and that's that. Come sundown, that makes a clean getaway.

Val was almost within reaching distance of Scott now, and he somehow sensed it, turning his head around. His eyes went wild, and for a moment I felt like I could actually see his nerves fray and snap. His upper lip curled back over bared teeth so far it looked inhuman. He swung the revolver to point it straight at Val's serene face, and pulled the trigger. Her head was nowhere near the gun when it went off. She'd ducked to the side faster than I'd seen anyone move before, like Mayweather slipping a punch.

When Scott tried to aim the gun at her this time, screaming an unearthly scream, her hands were already up in a blur. She let him get another shot off, which I thought was pretty charitable of her, except there didn't seem to be anything behind her eyes but cold fury. It seemed for a second like she'd disarmed him as the gun dropped to the floor. It took a long time to fall. Then I noticed in the dim light of the wine cellar a glint of silver attached to his neck, a small knife labeled with the initials "AHB." His now empty hands went to his throat, and he crumpled over. We listened to quiet gasping for a minute as Val came over to untie me from the chair. By the time she'd finished, it had stopped.

Steps led up from the gravel driveway to the porch. Narrow unpainted wood planks extended the length of the house, along with windows that looked into rooms at the front of the house. Through them, I saw blinds, and a glint of something metallic, like a shutter.

We stood at the end of a long gravel drive, staring up at a large house with a dark red wood exterior. Steps to the east led to a porch that spanned the facade of the place, wrapping around to a deck in the back that presumably had a great view of the lake and the countryside. It was more ski lodge than cabin, and looked like it could comfortably shelter an entire biathlon team if it had to.

Val's Mercedes was parked to one side of the driveway.

Your friend Alan seemed like quite a romantic. Thing like that gets a guy in trouble."
"We all have things we'd rather not let go of. Even you."
"Like that?" I pointed to the gold ring on her necklace, which had come into view, resting on the front flap of her coat. She gave me a hard look, and for a second I'd thought I'd crossed the line. Then, a smile broke out on her face.
"C'mon, drive. I'll tell you the whole story on the way. 
"So where we headed?"
"What was the last time you were in Vegas?" We got in and I started the car.

We started off down the road and we began to talk, really talk, for the first time since I'd met her. We started off down the open road, in the shadow of the mountain, high above the valley and its waves and ribbons of untouched snow like an unmade bed. 

I was already getting thirsty, and no quantity of expensive bourbon was going to help.
